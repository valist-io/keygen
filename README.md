# Valist Keypair Generator

This tool allows you to easily generate an Ethereum keypair for use with the Valist GitHub Action.

## Usage

To generate a keypair, simply run:

```bash
npm run eth
```

This will print a keypair to screen. You can copy the private piece into your `VALIST_SIGNER` repository secret, and add the public address to your Valist Project!
